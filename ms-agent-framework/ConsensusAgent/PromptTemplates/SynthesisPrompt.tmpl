Your task:
1. Identify points where models agree (consensus points)
2. Identify points of disagreement and analyze why they differ
3. Synthesize the best answer by:
   - Including all consensus points
   - Evaluating conflicting views on merit
   - Combining complementary insights
4. Provide your reasoning for synthesis decisions
5. Assess overall confidence (consider both model confidence and agreement level)
6. Note if disagreements reflect legitimate theoretical differences
