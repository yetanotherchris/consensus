## ORIGINAL PROMPT:
The Dockerfile appears to do something strange with two environmental variables. The console application already checks for these env vars, so the Dockerfile doesn't need to

## FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
### Summary of Work

I need to remove the redundant environment variable checks from the Dockerfile's entrypoint script since the console application already validates these variables. This will:

1. Eliminate duplicate validation logic
2. Ensure consistent error messages come from the application
3. Simplify the Docker entrypoint script

The entrypoint script should only handle building the command-line arguments and executing the application, letting the C# code handle all validation.

Does this plan look correct? Should I proceed with removing those validation checks from the Dockerfile?

USER RESPONSE: yes

## CHANGES MADE:
Removed redundant environment variable validation from Dockerfile entrypoint script.

The Dockerfile previously contained shell script logic that checked for CONSENSUS_API_ENDPOINT and CONSENSUS_API_KEY environment variables, exiting with an error if they were not set. This validation was redundant because the C# console application already performs these exact checks in ConsensusAgentSettings.CreateFromArgsAndEnvironment(), throwing a SettingsException with appropriate error messages when the variables are missing.

The entrypoint script now only builds the command-line arguments and executes the application, delegating all validation to the C# code. This ensures consistent error handling and messaging through a single validation point.

### TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Modified: Dockerfile (lines 45-63)
- Removed: Shell script checks for CONSENSUS_API_ENDPOINT and CONSENSUS_API_KEY
- Retained: Command-line argument building and application execution
- Validation now handled solely by: src/Consensus.Core/Configuration/ConsensusAgentSettings.cs
