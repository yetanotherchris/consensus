Inside the "ms-agent-framework" directory, can you create a command line C# application.

This application should use the Microsoft Agent Framework (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/agent-framework/user-guide/agents/multi-turn-conversation?pivots=programming-language-csharp)

The command line app should take a prompt .txt file as an argument for its initial prompt.
The command line app should take a list of models from a text file with newline delimited lists of models. For example "x-ai/grok-3" \n "anthrophic/claude4"

The tool should use the Microsoft Agent Framework SDK to create Multi-Turn Conversations, where the models collectively create a consensus on the prompt.

In the ms-agent-framework is an "example-prompt.txt" file you can use.

For the LLM endpoint, you can use the environmental variable "ASKLLM_API_ENDPOINT"
For the LLM key, you can use the environmental variable "ASKLLM_API_KEY"

-------
My Planned Tasks:
Set up the C# project structure (Console application with necessary NuGet packages)
Implement command-line argument parsing for prompt file and models file
Integrate Microsoft Agent Framework SDK for multi-turn conversations
Create the consensus logic where models take turns discussing the prompt
Handle environment variable configuration for API endpoint and key
Add error handling and validation for file inputs and API calls
Test the application with the existing example prompt
Questions before I proceed:
Model format: When you mention models like "x-ai/grok-3" and "anthropic/claude4", are these the exact model identifiers that the Microsoft Agent Framework expects, or do they need to be mapped to specific framework model names?

Consensus mechanism: How should the models reach consensus? Should they:

Take turns providing responses and building on each other's answers?
Vote on the best response after all provide initial answers?
Have a specific number of rounds of discussion?
Output format: How should the final consensus be presented? As a single agreed-upon response, or should it show the discussion process and final agreement?

Models file location: Should I create an example models file, or do you have a specific format/location in mind?

Does this plan look correct, and could you clarify these questions so I can build exactly what you need?

1. No - I am using openrouter. So use openrouter model names. The environmental variables I mentioned will allow you to call the endpoint and get responses, if you need to test.
2. I think they should take turns, as per a conversation. But voting is an excellent idea. Keep the code simple though please, don't introduce overly engineered solutions with complex voting systems. Keep the number of rounds to 5 (so with 5 models, this would be 25 requests)
3. Output format should be markdown, a single agreed upon response. The agreement process should be written to a separate file using a log format. This should be easy to read, so the model's response and proposed changes, vote should be shortened for this log
4. I have created a models.txt file with a list of models in it

-------

Excellent! Now I have all the information I need. Here's my refined plan:

Implementation Plan
Create C# Console Application with .NET 8/9 and required NuGet packages (Microsoft Agent Framework, HTTP client libraries)
Implement command-line parsing for prompt file and models file paths
Build OpenRouter integration using the Microsoft Agent Framework with environment variables
Implement multi-turn conversation logic (5 rounds with all models participating)
Add simple voting mechanism after each round
Generate two outputs:
Final consensus response in Markdown format
Conversation log showing the discussion process (shortened for readability)
Add proper error handling and validation

---------
My requirements were to use the Microsoft Agent Framework: Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI

You are using OpenAI.

You're absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion. Let me fix this to use the actual Microsoft Agent Framework packages. Let me first check what's available and then update the project.
